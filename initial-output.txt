I’ve scaffolded LetterWave Quest exactly according to the design spec:

• Added a top-level .gitignore, requirements.txt and README.md
• Created a letterwave/ package with:
    – renderer.py (draws A–Z glyphs and samples them into waveforms, vectorized for performance)
    – audioio.py (assembles segments, normalizes and writes 16-bit PCM WAVs)
    – player.py (plays back via simpleaudio if installed)
    – main.py (console UI with “New Composition”, “Options” and save/share loop)
    – __main__.py (so you can run python -m letterwave)
    – __init__.py (package version)

Next steps:

1. Install dependencies:      pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the app:      python -m letterwave

Happy coding and listening! Let me know if you’d like any further tweaks.
